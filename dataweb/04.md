# Getting Started with Census APIs: TIGERweb API

This post will cover how to get started using the [TIGERweb API](https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/TIGERweb_main.html). This is a REST API serviced by Census, but provisioned by ESRI.

### What You Will Learn

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use TIGERweb, an API that allows you to get geographic boundaries in a variety of formats:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- GeoJSON (Geographic JavaScript Object Notation)
- KMZ (Keyhole Markup language Zipped)
- AMF (Area Master File)

These boundary files allow users to create maps with Census data. While we will not cover how to connect your data to these shapes in this tutorial (as how you might do this depends on your technology stack), we will be covering how to navigate through the various endpoints within TIGERweb to find and retrieve what you need to do so. We will be covering some technology specific means of connecting data to geographic boundaries in future tutorials.

## The TIGERweb Web Mapping Service (WMS)

TIGERweb has a number of services, which cater to different needs. Here is a brief overview of those services:
