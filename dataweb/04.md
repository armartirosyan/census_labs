# Getting Started with Census Data: TIGER Services

This post will cover how to get started using [TIGER/Line FTP ](ftp://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger) services and introduce you to the [TIGERweb Web Mapping Service API](https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/TIGERweb_main.html). TIGERweb is a REST API serviced by Census, but provisioned by ESRI.

### What You Will Learn

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Census' services to get boundary files to match up with our statistical data.

These boundary files allow users to create maps with Census data. While we will not cover how to connect your data to these shapes in this tutorial (as how you might do this depends on your technology stack), we will be covering how to navigate through the various Census services to find and retrieve what you need. We will be covering some technology specific means of connecting data to geographic boundaries in future tutorials.

## The TIGER/Line FTP website

For general purposes (e.g., creating maps using Census data and geographies), users are encouraged to download shapefiles via FTP from [Census' FTP site for TIGER files](ftp://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger). Boundary files are very large. As such, requesting them via API can not only be prohibitive (timeouts due to large requests), but can also be impractical in terms of performance for production-ready applications.

We'll cover how to navigate this FTP site and get the boundaries for our data (2016 vintage states and territories).

### Step 1. Getting the Right Vintage of boundaries

From [Census' FTP site for TIGER files](ftp://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger), scan down to find the 2016 vintage `TIGER2016`.

This will get us a list of available layers (although somewhat cryptically).

If you're having a hard time finding the file which corresponds to the geographic resolution you need, first review the section on Geographies in the intro tutorial and - if you're still having troubles - please reach out via the contact info below and we will be happy to assist you.

In our case, we're looking for states, i.e., the `STATE/` file. Follow the link and click the file located therein to begin your download.

### Step 2. Translating the Shapefile into GeoJSON

In catering to the broadest audience with this tutorial, we're choosing an open standard to translate the files into. Other formats are supported by the following service and other services, depending upon your needs.

The service we will be using is a free service provided by [AcuGIS](https://www.acugis.com/). Thank you for your public service AcuGIS!

Go to [http://2geojson.com/index.php](http://2geojson.com/index.php).

All you have to do here is click the "Choose File" button, select your file and leave all the other fields as default/blank. This is a server-side service, so be patient as the file is uploaded and converted. Once it's converted you'll see a green dialog alert that allows you to "Click Here to DownLoad."

There was a little hiccup when I made this translation, which you may run into when you do your conversion that there was an extra new line at the top and another the bottom of the data that you'll need to remove... free ain't free ;).

You might also find - like I did - that larger .geojson files might crash your text editor (Atom, in my case). Sublime text worked for me for this purpose.

For your convenience, I've included the resulting translation in the [assets/shapes folder](./assets/shapes.2016-states.geojson) of this repo where you should be able to see the shapes rendered in github or you can use a third-party web viewer to verify yours at [mapshaper.org](http://mapshaper.org/).

## The TIGERweb Web Mapping Service (WMS)

Census also provides an [API](https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/TIGERweb_wms.html) that allows you to get geographic boundaries in a variety of formats:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- GeoJSON (Geographic JavaScript Object Notation)
- KMZ (Keyhole Markup language Zipped)
- AMF (Area Master File)

However, since boundaries - unlike statistics - can be a huge request even for a small selection of geographies (think in terms of MB rather than KB) this service should only be used if you have a very specific need. Some use cases where using the WMS would make sense would be:

- if you have specialty area/shape and would like to get a nested set of Census areas within it
- if you can't find a shapefile translation service to get the files into a format you can use that is listed above
- if you're creating an application that only needs a small number of geographies and want to make the requests programatically

Otherwise, you are probably better off using FTP to download the shapes, translating to your preferred format for storage in your own mapping server or third party service (e.g., CartoDB, MapBox, etc.).

## Making Our First TIGERweb API Call


Here's what that request translates into a RESTful URL:

https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/tigerWMS_ACS2016/MapServer/82/query?where=1%3D1&text=&objectIds=&time=&geometry=&geometryType=esriGeometryEnvelope&inSR=&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&relationParam=&outFields=&returnGeometry=true&returnTrueCurves=false&maxAllowableOffset=&geometryPrecision=&outSR=&returnIdsOnly=false&returnCountOnly=false&orderByFields=&groupByFieldsForStatistics=&outStatistics=&returnZ=false&returnM=false&gdbVersion=&returnDistinctValues=false&resultOffset=&resultRecordCount=&f=geojson

Let's break this down:
