# Census: The [Mirepoix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirepoix_(cuisine)) of Open Data


### Initial user stories (todo):
1. Use individual services or combine them in powerful ways
2. Create Maps with Open Data
3. Create GraphQL 'facades' of other open-datasets to create mashups
4. Compare Data through Space and Time

## Introduction
All Census data are referenced within at least **three 'frames'**:

1. **Geographic Area** (where)
2. **Timeframe** (when)
3. **Survey** (who and/or what)

We are going to spare you hours (maybe even days) of confusion by going over these three concepts briefly to - at least - provide a basic understanding of the lexicon so that you can 'Google' in a more savvy manner. While this readme may look long at first glance, you would be prudent to read it from beginning to end. It will pay dividends in the end to do so ;)

### Contact
If you have any questions, need any assistance or run into *any* problems, please reach out on Census' [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/uscensusbureau/home) or send an email to: <cnmp.developers.list@census.gov>


##### Now, Let's Get Started!
---

## Frame 1 - Census Geographic Areas
Census data are released to the public as 'aggregated data.' I.e., in order to protect the confidentiality of respondents', the US Census Bureau tabulates its data into geographic areas rather than publishing exact (point) locations. For new Census data users, this is the first point (ironic pun intended) of confusion.

New users may be familiar with other popular data providers (e.g., Twitter, Google Maps, etc.) who publish data with a latitude & longitude coordinate and thus may expect something similar from the Census. However, by law, Census must publish data within areas (i.e., a shape composed of a payload of bounding coordinates).

#### Area Hierarchy
Census areas have a hierarchical structure wherein some areas nest within others. This will be more important to you as you seek to get lower-level areas' data. To do so, you must specify a higher level as a frame of reference. Here is a handy diagram, which breaks it down succinctly:

![Census Areas Hierarchy](https://factfinder.census.gov/common/img/en/geo_hierarchy.png "Census Areas Hierarchy")

*Download a detailed diagram  [here](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/geodiagram.pdf)*

##### See the hierarchy as a tree list [here](./figures/censushierarchy.md)

##### Here is an example of what this nested relationship looks like 'on the ground':

![Example of these nested relationships](https://nursekey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/F000154f15-06-9781455707621.jpg "Example of these nested relationships")


#### Use-Case: Accessing Small Area Data
In order to access the lowest levels (e.g., tracts, block groups, blocks), users will have to make requests which reference a frame within this hierarchy. For example, Census' current [data API](http://api.census.gov/data.html) allows users to get all the Counties in the US in a single call, but anything lower than that needs to be framed.

The Census currently allows users to get data 'two levels down' from a framing reference. For example, to get the 'Total Population' of all the tracts in the US, users will need to make a separate call for each state, like this:

<http://api.census.gov/data/2010/sf1?get=P0010001&for=tract:*&in=state:02&in=county:*>

*NOTE to Jonas: We will replace this with our GraphQL example when we have it*

#### Use-Case: Changes Over Time
For new users trying to compare Census data over time, one of the most surprising - and frustrating - things about Census geographic areas is that they *change over time*. Inconveniently, Census geographic areas shift through political annexations, splits and are [otherwise changed](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_boundarychange.html) with each release of the data. It is important to note that changes are more frequent at the lower levels of geography, which are subject to a greater variety of legislation (state and local).

Here's an example from [Provplan](http://provplan.org/dataspark/) of Census tract changes in Providence, RI:

![Ex: Tract Changes Over Time](http://datasparkri.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChangeinCensusTractBoundaries1990-2010.jpg "Ex: Tract Changes Over Time")

While we won't go into detail about the 'why' of these boundary changes here, please feel free to reach out to the contacts provided above if you have any questions. For now, let's focus on *how* this will impact your work.

*If you're feeling a little overwhelmed at this point, you're not alone! Though this document is geared toward giving you the many caveats to using these data, depending on your use-case, you may not need to worry about them. We are here to help you assess the complexity of your use-case. Again, don't hesitate to use the contacts!*

## Frame 2 - Time

Aside from Census area boundaries, the human and organizational makeup of the US changes over time. Data users can leverage Census data to see what that makeup looks like in the most current 'snapshot', historically or longitudinally.

To facilitate these different use-cases, Census publishes data in two temporal forms:
1. Time Series
2. Vintages

### Time Series
*NOTE for Jonas: Time Series Endpoint: <http://api.census.gov/data/timeseries.html>*

#### Use-Case: Changes over Time for General Characteristics at Higher Levels of Geography
Time series data are typically released at higher levels of geography (lowest level = county). By releasing time series data at higher levels of geography, the Census tries to balance the data end-users' utility with the need to preserve respondent confidentiality, which may be compromised if smaller areas where to be used, and complexity of dealing with [relationship files](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/relationship.html). We will not go into the details of 'why' here, but - as always - please feel free to reach out with any questions.

If your needs can be addressed at a higher level of geography and do not require a very sophisticated demographic profile, your best bet is to leverage time series datasets for their power to show changes over time easily.


### Vintages
*NOTE for Jonas: Vintage endpoints are prefixed with a specific reference year, e.g.: <http://api.census.gov/data/2010.html>*

We have found that many users of Census data want to dive deeper into the details. Whether it be in terms of a more precise resolution of geography (e.g., neighborhoods/tracts) or more comprehensive demographic profiles. If your use-case has similar demands, vintages will be the way to go.

Vintage is the term the US Census Bureau uses to reference a dataset by a specific year. Some data are collected over a period of years, others are collected and published for a single year, but all datasets use a single year as a reference of time for the purposes of programmatic access.

#### Use-Case: Get Pre-Tabulated Characteristics for a Single Vintage
Most vintage data are published pre-cross-tabulated in order to make publication possible in a manner that balances comprehensive profile coverage within manageable data storage constraints. Users have access to a vast number of potential combinations of Characteristics under various vintages of data, but navigating the possible combinations will take some time. For new users, the Census provides a couple of tools ([American Factfinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) and  [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov)) to do help you with this.

#### Use-Case: Creating Custom Tabulations: Using Microdata
Some surveys publish record-level data with personal information removed for users to create custom profiles. The caveat with Microdata use is that they are made publicly available only within a geographic frame of > 100K population (called [PUMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Use_Microdata_Area)s) and do not include personally identifiable information (e.g., names and addresses) to preserve confidentiality. For users who want very specific profile characteristics, but do not need high granularity of geographic resolution, Microdata can be very handy.

## Frame 3 - Survey
The US Census Bureau conducts many surveys. While [its namesake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census) (aka 'The Decennial Census) is conducted as a complete count of every household in the US, the Bureau also conducts [over 130 other surveys](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/are-you-in-a-survey/survey-list.html) which use sampling (of various sample sizes) to provide a broad base of statistics for a wide-variety of public service uses.

Each survey is conducted to cover a specific subject(s). For example, the American Community Survey [covers](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/subjects.html) people and households, while the Economic Census [covers](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census/guidance/series/subject-summary.html) businesses and organizations in the private sector.

Given the exhaustive list of surveys the Census conducts, it helps to use a search engine to identify which survey is of most interest to your use-case. The US Census website also allows you to navigate the landscape of [surveys by topic](https://www.census.gov/topics/).

*NOTE for Jonas: This might be ameliorated in the future with data.census.gov, but we may want to consider how we can improve this with GQL*
